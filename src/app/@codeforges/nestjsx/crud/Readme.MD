### Crud Resource

The crud resource is made to reflect the auto generated routes on backend for the `nestjsx/crud` lib

#### Usage
If you are creating a `Resource service` that describes a `nest` resources generated by `@Crud()`
You just need to extend from the CrudResource class:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export MySpecialResource extends CrudResource<MyCoolResponseInterface>{
    constructor(httpClient: HttpClient) {
        super('api/root/url', httpClient);
    }
}
```

Now your  `MySpecialResource` service will have all crud methods that reflect you bacend Resource generated by [nestjsx/crud](https://github.com/nestjsx/crud)
